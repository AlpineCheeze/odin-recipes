# Odin Project: Recipes
Welcome to my first project

HeLlO WoRlD!!

In this project, I will demonstrate the skills I have learned thus far in the Odin Project!
As part of the project, I will utilize the HTML and CSS that I've learned so far as I follow along with the Odin Project. 
I will also be sure to use commits early and often to document my workflow and progress.

Placeholder for future explaination of project and skills demonstrated.
